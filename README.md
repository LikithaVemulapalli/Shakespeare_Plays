# Shakespeare plays - To be, or not to be

For this project, I have considered Shakespeare plays dataset from Kaggle.

Shakespeare plays: https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays

Steps to execute: 

1. Download the files from the github repository. 
2. Get the Shakespeare_data.csv file by unzipping the Shakespear_data.rar file. 
3. Place the csv files in datasets folder and place the datasets folder in notebooks folder. The notebooks folder should also have ipynb file as well. 
4. Navigate to terminal and type "jupyter notebook" 
5. Navigate to the folder where the notebook is placed. 
6. From the menu icon cell, click on Run all which will run the whole notebook from the first cell. Verify the results.

The project is all about building classification models to determine the Player using the other columns as features.

Steps to follow:

1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account.
2. Download the Shakespeare plays dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/shakespeare-plays
3. Load the data sets into panda data frames following the 10 minutes to pandas guide
4. Formulate one or two ideas on how the data sets could be combined to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
5. Build one or more classification models to determine the player using the other columns as features
6. Document your process and results
7. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
